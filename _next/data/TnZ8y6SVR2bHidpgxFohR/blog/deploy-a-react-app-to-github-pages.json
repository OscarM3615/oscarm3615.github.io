Add remote to Github\n\nIf you don't have a Github repo linked to your project, run the following command,\notherwise, skip this step:\n\n```bash\ngit remote add origin https://github.com/<username>/<repo-name>.git\ngit push -u origin main # Upload changes to Github\n```\n\n#### 2\\. Add extra dev dependency gh-pages\n\nAdd `gh-pages` to your project as a development dependency:\n\n```bash\nnpm install gh-pages --save-dev\n```\n\n#### 3\\. Add deploy script\n\nOpen `package.json` and put the homepage url and the deploy script:\n\n```json\n{\n  \"homepage\": \"https://<username>.github.io/<repo-name>\",\n  \"scripts\": {\n    \"deploy\": \"gh-pages -d build\"\n  }\n}\n```\n\n_If you are deploying to your profile page, `<repo-name>` is not needed._\n\n#### 4\\. Build and deploy your app\n\nRun the following commands from terminal:\n\n```bash\nnpm build # Build your React app for production\nnpm deploy # Upload build folder to gh-pages branch\n```\n\n#### 5\\. Set up github repo for Github Pages\n\nGo to your repo on Github, Settings, Pages and select the Source as `gh-pages` branch.\n\nIt will display the link to visit your React app.\n\n### Notes\n\nGithub Pages does not work well with Single Page Applications, as it doesn't\nknow how to redirect all the routes to `index.html`, some alternatives are:\n\n- Using `HashRouter` instead of `BrowserRouter` (in case you're using react router).\n- Hosting your app in another service (like Firebase).\n- Using [the following fix](https://github.com/rafgraph/spa-github-pages).\n"}},"__N_SSG":true}
