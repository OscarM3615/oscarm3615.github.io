# Portfolio

My personal website created with Next.js, Bootstrap 5 and Markdown.

## Features

### Content

The main page contains information [about me](https://github.com/OscarM3615).
The data is fetched from the [Github API](https://docs.github.com/en/rest).

The blog posts are written with Markdown and rendered with
[Marked](https://github.com/markedjs/marked).

### Libraries

- **[Next.js](https://nextjs.org/)**: Used to build the main UI, routing and
    SEO.
- **[Bootstrap](https://getbootstrap.com/)**: Customise the website appearance
    (themed with custom SASS).
- **[Bootstrap Icons](https://icons.getbootstrap.com/)**: Used for website
    decoration.

### Hosting

I use [Github Pages](https://pages.github.com/) to simplify deployment as a
static website.
